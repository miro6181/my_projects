"""Technical Exercise Question 1 written in Atom
Author: Michael Rogers


DIRECIONS TO TEST THE CODE:

AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE THERE IS AN INSTANTIATION AND TEST OF THE CODE.
YOU CAN EITHER REPLACE THE 'test.txt' IN THE INSTANTIATION WITH YOUR OWN TEST
FILE OR CREATE A FILE NAMED 'test.txt'.
THE TEST FILE I USED HAS THE FOLLOWING:

This is a file in the test file.
It has 40 words, 2 sentences, and 28 unique words to test the technical exercise.
Third line
Fourth line
Fifth line
Sixth line
Seventh line
Eighth line
Ninth line
Tenth line
etc.

IMPORTANT: BOTH THE 'text_analyzer.py' FILE AND THE TEST FILE MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY
FOR THE CODE TO EXECUTE PROPERLY. OR YOU MUST PUT THE FILE PATH IN THE
INSTANTIATION. """

# Create a text content analyzer. This is a tool used by writers to find statistics such as word and sentence count on essays or articles they are writing.
# Write a Python program that analyzes input from a file and compiles statistics on it.
# The program should output:
# 1. The total word count
# 2. The count of unique words
# 3. The number of sentences
# Example output:
#
# Total word count: 468
# Unique words: 223
# Sentences: 38
# Brownie points will be awarded for the following extras:
# 1. The ability to calculate the average sentence length in words
# 2. The ability to find often used phrases (a phrase of 3 or more words used over 3 times)
# 3. A list of words used, in order of descending frequency
# 4. The ability to accept input from STDIN, or from a file specified on the command line.
# This question should be written in Python.
